# The App
The App is currently in its very early stages with not a lot of functions implemented and the design being quite lacking (just downright ugly, or as I like to call it "functional").

## Currently Working Features
* Login / Authentication
* Save credentials and log in with Windows Hello
* Loading account and balance
* Loading and showing spaces
* Loading and showing transactions
* Save all of the above in an encrypted offline cache

## Not Working Features
* Literally everything else

# Contributing
Anyone is welcome to help.

Since it's currently at the "throw code in and show somewhat useful results" state, especially help with design is welcome since I'm far from an expert in that kind of thing. 

Coding help is also welcome, so feel free to create a pull request!

If you find a bug, want a feature of have great ideas please do create an issue!
